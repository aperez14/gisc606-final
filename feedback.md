What was your favorite part of the class?
I enjoyed your narration and having fun throughout the lecture with some added commentary not just reading off the lessons.

What was your least favorite part of the class?
I made the mistake of not attending the first class (I didn't check to see that we had class), this helped me fall behind. During the class I didn't realize how to install packages/open a notebook and it overwhelmed me but I was too shy to ask for help. I eventually figured it out but it was just unnecessarily overwhelming. The Youtube recording are blurry but that might be my poor internet? 

Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?
Provide Zoom recordings if possible, and/or add chapters to the youtube videos for the lab being worked on? Provide additional resources in your syllabus for urban remote sensing, and other things you might think are cool and useful to know. Maybe provide a 5-10 minute break, the lab sprint runs could be a lot but I understand that it might've helped things move faster.
