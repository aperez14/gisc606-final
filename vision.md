What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?
My dream job in GIS is teaching GIS to community. I want to be in a position to interact with people and empower them with the tools GIS has to effect change in policy, in my dream job I would not be in front of a screen 9 hours a day. I would get to go outside to collect data and hike, then return to my computer and process when the weather is too extreme or I need a break.

What GIS applications or technologies excite you most? 
I'm excited to have more time to explore QGIS and using python to do spatial analysis! I am excited for the future of GeoAI and what map illustrations may look like in the future and how that will change people's interpretation of spatial data, good and bad. I am very excited for tools that claim to be breakthroughs for assigning population by varying boundaries such as the apportion tool in ArcPro, this is an industry wide question provided the many complicting juristictional boundaries and the need to assign values from overlapping boundaries.

What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?
I want to focus on creating an open source website to join SWITRS TIMS SafeTrec data to US Bike Routes data and be able to provide policymakers and public officials with data on bike collisions by bike route class type. I want to explore using QGIS to engage with OpenSource data and continue exploring how to do remote sensing that can be useful for the public, especially during emergencies. Non-GIS hobbies will include kayaking, hiking, volunteering at the animal shelter, and maybe beading.
